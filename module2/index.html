<p> I have been playing the piano since I was 9 years old and since then, I have been an active musician. My first composition was when I was 11 years old and later I had the opportuity to participate in composition competitions for three times: 2009 in Seoul, South Korea; 2012 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and 2015 in Taipei, Taiwan. Afterwards I arranged local concerts in my city, which is Guadalajara, Mexico and the most important was in the PALCCO concert hall in 2019, in which I played a whole repertory of: Bach, Beethoven, Liszt, Ponce and my recent compositions for piano. </p>
